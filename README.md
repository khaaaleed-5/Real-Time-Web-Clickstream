# **Real-time Web Clickstream Analytics**

The Real-time Web Clickstream Analytics project focuses on collecting and analyzing real-time user interactions within a website. This analysis helps understand user behavior, navigation paths, and identifies potential optimization areas to enhance the user experience.

## **Project Description**

The primary goal of this project is to:

- **Collect real-time data** on user interactions within a website, known as clickstream data.
- **Analyze the sequence** of pages visited by users during a single session, enabling insights into user behavior and time spent on the website.
- **Identify and analyze paths** users take through the website to uncover popular paths, drop-off points, and potential bottlenecks in the user journey.

### **Key Objectives**

- **Data Collection:** Gather real-time clickstream data including page visits, timestamps, and user interactions.
- **Analytics and Processing:** Utilize Apache Kafka for data ingestion, Apache Spark for real-time analytics, and sequence analysis to understand user behavior.
- **Insights and Visualization:** Derive insights and visualize findings to identify popular paths, drop-off points, and user journey optimizations.

## **Repository Structure**

### `data/`
- Contains sample or generated clickstream data for analysis.
- You can find dataset used in "data/data_stream/Dataset.csv"

### `code/`
- Includes code snippets or scripts used for data ingestion, Apache Spark processing, and analytics.

### `docs/`
- Additional documentation, project-related resources, and kafka commands.

### `results/`
- Outputs, reports, or visualizations showcasing insights derived from the analysis.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**
